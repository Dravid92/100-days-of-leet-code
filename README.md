Given an array of integers nums.

A pair (i,j) is called good if nums[i] == nums[j] and i < j.

Return the number of good pairs.

### Example:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,1,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 good pairs (0,3), (0,4), (3,4), (2,5) 0-indexed.

## [(E)Problem 3 :](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Shuffle_the_array.py)
Given the array nums consisting of 2n elements in the form [x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn].

Return the array in the form [x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn].

### Example:

Input: nums = [2,5,1,3,4,7], n = 3
Output: [2,3,5,4,1,7] 
Explanation: Since x1=2, x2=5, x3=1, y1=3, y2=4, y3=7 then the answer is [2,3,5,4,1,7].

## [(E)Problem 4 :](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Number_of_students_homeworking.py)
Given two integer arrays startTime and endTime and given an integer queryTime.

The ith student started doing their homework at the time startTime[i] and finished it at time endTime[i].

Return the number of students doing their homework at time queryTime. More formally, return the number of students where queryTime lays in the interval [startTime[i], endTime[i]] inclusive.

### Example:

Input: startTime = [1,2,3], endTime = [3,2,7], queryTime = 4
Output: 1
Explanation: We have 3 students where:
The first student started doing homework at time 1 and finished at time 3 and wasn't doing anything at time 4.
The second student started doing homework at time 2 and finished at time 2 and also wasn't doing anything at time 4.
The third student started doing homework at time 3 and finished at time 7 and was the only student doing homework at time 4.

## [(E)Problem 5 :](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Max_product_of_elements.py)
Given the array of integers nums, you will choose two different indices i and j of that array. Return the maximum value of (nums[i]-1)*(nums[j]-1).
 
### Example:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,2]
Output: 12 
Explanation: If you choose the indices i=1 and j=2 (indexed from 0), you will get the maximum value, that is, (nums[1]-1)*(nums[2]-1) = (4-1)*(5-1) = 3*4 = 12.

## [(E)Problem 6 :](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Max_69_numbers.py)
Given a positive integer num consisting only of digits 6 and 9.

Return the maximum number you can get by changing at most one digit (6 becomes 9, and 9 becomes 6).

### Example:

Input: num = 9669
Output: 9969
Explanation: 
Changing the first digit results in 6669.
Changing the second digit results in 9969.
Changing the third digit results in 9699.
Changing the fourth digit results in 9666. 
The maximum number is 9969.


## [(E)Problem 7:](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Destination.py)
You are given the array paths, where paths[i] = [cityAi, cityBi] means there exists a direct path going from cityAi to cityBi. Return the destination city, that is, the city without any path outgoing to another city.

It is guaranteed that the graph of paths forms a line without any loop, therefore, there will be exactly one destination city.

### Example:

Input: paths = [["London","New York"],["New York","Lima"],["Lima","Sao Paulo"]]
Output: "Sao Paulo" 
Explanation: Starting at "London" city you will reach "Sao Paulo" city which is the destination city. Your trip consist of: "London" -> "New York" -> "Lima" -> "Sao Paulo".

## [(E)Problem 8:](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Morse_code.py)
International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is mapped to a series of dots and dashes, as follows: "a" maps to ".-", "b" maps to "-...", "c" maps to "-.-.", and so on.

For convenience, the full table for the 26 letters of the English alphabet is given below:

[".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]
Now, given a list of words, each word can be written as a concatenation of the Morse code of each letter. For example, "cab" can be written as "-.-..--...", (which is the concatenation "-.-." + ".-" + "-..."). We'll call such a concatenation, the transformation of a word.

Return the number of different transformations among all words we have.

### Example:

Input: words = ["gin", "zen", "gig", "msg"]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The transformation of each word is:
"gin" -> "--...-."
"zen" -> "--...-."
"gig" -> "--...--."
"msg" -> "--...--."

There are 2 different transformations, "--...-." and "--...--.".

## [(E)Problem 9 :](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Decrypt_str_alp.py)
Given a string s formed by digits ('0' - '9') and '#' . We want to map s to English lowercase characters as follows:

Characters ('a' to 'i') are represented by ('1' to '9') respectively.
Characters ('j' to 'z') are represented by ('10#' to '26#') respectively. 
Return the string formed after mapping.

It's guaranteed that a unique mapping will always exist.

### Example:

Input: s = "10#11#12"
Output: "jkab"
Explanation: "j" -> "10#" , "k" -> "11#" , "a" -> "1" , "b" -> "2".

## [(E)Problem 10 :](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Count_neg.py)

Given a m * n matrix grid which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise. 

Return the number of negative numbers in grid.

### Example:

Input: grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.

## [(E)Problem 11 :](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/N_unique_sum_zero.py)
Given an integer n, return any array containing n unique integers such that they add up to 0.

### Example:

Input: n = 5
Output: [-7,-1,1,3,4]
Explanation: These arrays also are accepted [-5,-1,1,2,3] , [-3,-1,2,-2,4].

## [(E)Problem 12 :](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/flip_a_image.py)
Given a binary matrix A, we want to flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.

To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.  For example, flipping [1, 1, 0] horizontally results in [0, 1, 1].

To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0. For example, inverting [0, 1, 1] results in [1, 0, 0].

### Example:

Input: [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]].
Then, invert the image: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]

## [(E)Problem 13 :](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Replace_with_largest.py)
Given an array arr, replace every element in that array with the greatest element among the elements to its right, and replace the last element with -1.

After doing so, return the array.

### Example:

Input: arr = [17,18,5,4,6,1]
Output: [18,6,6,6,1,-1]

## [(E)Problem 14 :](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/increasing_decreasing.py)
Given a string s. You should re-order the string using the following algorithm:

Pick the smallest character from s and append it to the result.
Pick the smallest character from s which is greater than the last appended character to the result and append it.
Repeat step 2 until you cannot pick more characters.
Pick the largest character from s and append it to the result.
Pick the largest character from s which is smaller than the last appended character to the result and append it.
Repeat step 5 until you cannot pick more characters.
Repeat the steps from 1 to 6 until you pick all characters from s.
In each step, If the smallest or the largest character appears more than once you can choose any occurrence and append it to the result.

### Example:

Input: s = "aaaabbbbcccc"
Output: "abccbaabccba"
Explanation: After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the first iteration, result = "abc"
After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the first iteration, result = "abccba"
First iteration is done. Now s = "aabbcc" and we go back to step 1
After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabc"
After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabccba"

## [(E)Problem 15 :](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Gen_str_oddcounts.py)

Given an integer n, return a string with n characters such that each character in such string occurs an odd number of times.

The returned string must contain only lowercase English letters. If there are multiples valid strings, return any of them.  

### Example:

Input: n = 4
Output: "pppz"
Explanation: "pppz" is a valid string since the character 'p' occurs three times and the character 'z' occurs once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ohhh" and "love".

## [(E)Problem 16 :](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Final_price_discount.py)

Given the array prices where prices[i] is the price of the ith item in a shop. There is a special discount for items in the shop, if you buy the ith item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[j] where j is the minimum index such that j > i and prices[j] <= prices[i], otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.

Return an array where the ith element is the final price you will pay for the ith item of the shop considering the special discount.

### Example:

Input: prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
Output: [4,2,4,2,3]
Explanation: 
For item 0 with price[0]=8 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[1]=4, therefore, the final price you will pay is 8 - 4 = 4. 
For item 1 with price[1]=4 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 4 - 2 = 2. 
For item 2 with price[2]=6 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 6 - 2 = 4. 
For items 3 and 4 you will not receive any discount at all.

## [(E)Problem 17](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Self_div_nums.py)

A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.

For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because 128 % 1 == 0, 128 % 2 == 0, and 128 % 8 == 0.

Also, a self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.

Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self dividing number, including the bounds if possible.

### Example 1:
Input: 
left = 1, right = 22
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22

## [(E)Problem 18](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/sort_array_parity.py)

Given an array A of non-negative integers, return an array consisting of all the even elements of A, followed by all the odd elements of A.

You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.

### Example 1:

Input: [3,1,2,4]
Output: [2,4,3,1]
The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.

## [(E)Problem 19](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Arthimetic_seq_detect.py)

Given an array of numbers arr. A sequence of numbers is called an arithmetic progression if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

Return true if the array can be rearranged to form an arithmetic progression, otherwise, return false.

### Example 1:

Input: arr = [3,5,1]
Output: true
Explanation: We can reorder the elements as [1,3,5] or [5,3,1] with differences 2 and -2 respectively, between each consecutive elements.

## [(E)Problem 20](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Make_two_arr_equal.py)

Given two integer arrays of equal length target and arr.

In one step, you can select any non-empty sub-array of arr and reverse it. You are allowed to make any number of steps.

Return True if you can make arr equal to target, or False otherwise.

### Example 1:

Input: target = [1,2,3,4], arr = [2,4,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: You can follow the next steps to convert arr to target:
1- Reverse sub-array [2,4,1], arr becomes [1,4,2,3]
2- Reverse sub-array [4,2], arr becomes [1,2,4,3]
3- Reverse sub-array [4,3], arr becomes [1,2,3,4]
There are multiple ways to convert arr to target, this is not the only way to do so.

## [(E)Problem 21](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/N_repeated_element.py)

In a array A of size 2N, there are N+1 unique elements, and exactly one of these elements is repeated N times.

Return the element repeated N times.

### Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3,3]
Output: 3

## [(E)Problem 22](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Robo_return_origin.py)

There is a robot starting at position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at (0, 0) after it completes its moves.

The move sequence is represented by a string, and the character moves[i] represents its ith move. Valid moves are R (right), L (left), U (up), and D (down). If the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its moves, return true. Otherwise, return false.

Note: The way that the robot is "facing" is irrelevant. "R" will always make the robot move to the right once, "L" will always make it move left, etc. Also, assume that the magnitude of the robot's movement is the same for each move.

### Example 1:

Input: "UD"
Output: true 
Explanation: The robot moves up once, and then down once. All moves have the same magnitude, so it ended up at the origin where it started. Therefore, we return true.

## [(E)Problem 23](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Hamming_dis.py)

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

### Example:

Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       â†‘   â†‘

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

## [(E)Problem 24](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/square_sorted.py)

Given a string S that only contains "I" (increase) or "D" (decrease), let N = S.length.

Return any permutation A of [0, 1, ..., N] such that for all i = 0, ..., N-1:

If S[i] == "I", then A[i] < A[i+1]
If S[i] == "D", then A[i] > A[i+1]

### Example 1:

Input: "IDID"
Output: [0,4,1,3,2]

### Example 1:

Input: [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]

## [(E)Problem 26](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Peak_index.py)

Let's call an array A a mountain if the following properties hold:

A.length >= 3
There exists some 0 < i < A.length - 1 such that A[0] < A[1] < ... A[i-1] < A[i] > A[i+1] > ... > A[A.length - 1]
Given an array that is definitely a mountain, return any i such that A[0] < A[1] < ... A[i-1] < A[i] > A[i+1] > ... > A[A.length - 1].

## Example 1:

Input: [0,1,0]

Given an array of integers arr, write a function that returns true if and only if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique.

### Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.

## [(E)Problem 28](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Lucky_num.py)

Given a m * n matrix of distinct numbers, return all lucky numbers in the matrix in any order.

A lucky number is an element of the matrix such that it is the minimum element in its row and maximum in its column.

### Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[3,7,8],[9,11,13],[15,16,17]]
Output: [15]
Explanation: 15 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column
