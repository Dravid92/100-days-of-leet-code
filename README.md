Given the array of integers nums, you will choose two different indices i and j of that array. Return the maximum value of (nums[i]-1)*(nums[j]-1).
 
### Example:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,2]
Output: 12 
Explanation: If you choose the indices i=1 and j=2 (indexed from 0), you will get the maximum value, that is, (nums[1]-1)*(nums[2]-1) = (4-1)*(5-1) = 3*4 = 12.

## [(E)Problem 6 :](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Max_69_numbers.py)
Given a positive integer num consisting only of digits 6 and 9.

Return the maximum number you can get by changing at most one digit (6 becomes 9, and 9 becomes 6).

### Example:

Input: num = 9669
Output: 9969
Explanation: 
Changing the first digit results in 6669.
Changing the second digit results in 9969.
Changing the third digit results in 9699.
Changing the fourth digit results in 9666. 
The maximum number is 9969.


## [(E)Problem 7:](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Destination.py)
You are given the array paths, where paths[i] = [cityAi, cityBi] means there exists a direct path going from cityAi to cityBi. Return the destination city, that is, the city without any path outgoing to another city.

It is guaranteed that the graph of paths forms a line without any loop, therefore, there will be exactly one destination city.

### Example:

Input: paths = [["London","New York"],["New York","Lima"],["Lima","Sao Paulo"]]
Output: "Sao Paulo" 
Explanation: Starting at "London" city you will reach "Sao Paulo" city which is the destination city. Your trip consist of: "London" -> "New York" -> "Lima" -> "Sao Paulo".

## [(E)Problem 8:](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Morse_code.py)
International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is mapped to a series of dots and dashes, as follows: "a" maps to ".-", "b" maps to "-...", "c" maps to "-.-.", and so on.

For convenience, the full table for the 26 letters of the English alphabet is given below:

[".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]
Now, given a list of words, each word can be written as a concatenation of the Morse code of each letter. For example, "cab" can be written as "-.-..--...", (which is the concatenation "-.-." + ".-" + "-..."). We'll call such a concatenation, the transformation of a word.

Return the number of different transformations among all words we have.

### Example:

Input: words = ["gin", "zen", "gig", "msg"]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The transformation of each word is:
"gin" -> "--...-."
"zen" -> "--...-."
"gig" -> "--...--."
"msg" -> "--...--."

There are 2 different transformations, "--...-." and "--...--.".

## [(E)Problem 9 :](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Decrypt_str_alp.py)
Given a string s formed by digits ('0' - '9') and '#' . We want to map s to English lowercase characters as follows:

Characters ('a' to 'i') are represented by ('1' to '9') respectively.
Characters ('j' to 'z') are represented by ('10#' to '26#') respectively. 
Return the string formed after mapping.

It's guaranteed that a unique mapping will always exist.

### Example:

Input: s = "10#11#12"
Output: "jkab"
Explanation: "j" -> "10#" , "k" -> "11#" , "a" -> "1" , "b" -> "2".

## [(E)Problem 10 :](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Count_neg.py)

Given a m * n matrix grid which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise.

Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.

## [(E)Problem 11 :](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/N_unique_sum_zero.py)
Given an integer n, return any array containing n unique integers such that they add up to 0.

### Example:

Input: n = 5
Output: [-7,-1,1,3,4]
Explanation: These arrays also are accepted [-5,-1,1,2,3] , [-3,-1,2,-2,4].

## [(E)Problem 12 :](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/flip_a_image.py)
Given a binary matrix A, we want to flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.

To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.  For example, flipping [1, 1, 0] horizontally results in [0, 1, 1].

To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0. For example, inverting [0, 1, 1] results in [1, 0, 0].

### Example:

Input: [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]].
Then, invert the image: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]

## [(E)Problem 13 :](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Replace_with_largest.py)
Given an array arr, replace every element in that array with the greatest element among the elements to its right, and replace the last element with -1.

After doing so, return the array.

### Example:

Input: arr = [17,18,5,4,6,1]
Output: [18,6,6,6,1,-1]

## [(E)Problem 14 :](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/increasing_decreasing.py)
Given a string s. You should re-order the string using the following algorithm:

Pick the smallest character from s and append it to the result.
Pick the smallest character from s which is greater than the last appended character to the result and append it.
Repeat step 2 until you cannot pick more characters.
Pick the largest character from s and append it to the result.
Pick the largest character from s which is smaller than the last appended character to the result and append it.
Repeat step 5 until you cannot pick more characters.
Repeat the steps from 1 to 6 until you pick all characters from s.
In each step, If the smallest or the largest character appears more than once you can choose any occurrence and append it to the result.

### Example:

Input: s = "aaaabbbbcccc"
Output: "abccbaabccba"
Explanation: After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the first iteration, result = "abc"
After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the first iteration, result = "abccba"
First iteration is done. Now s = "aabbcc" and we go back to step 1
After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabc"
After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabccba"

## [(E)Problem 15 :](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Gen_str_oddcounts.py)

Given an integer n, return a string with n characters such that each character in such string occurs an odd number of times.

The returned string must contain only lowercase English letters. If there are multiples valid strings, return any of them.  

### Example:

Input: n = 4
Output: "pppz"
Explanation: "pppz" is a valid string since the character 'p' occurs three times and the character 'z' occurs once. Note that there are many other valid strings such as "ohhh" and "love".

## [(E)Problem 16 :](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Final_price_discount.py)

Given the array prices where prices[i] is the price of the ith item in a shop. There is a special discount for items in the shop, if you buy the ith item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[j] where j is the minimum index such that j > i and prices[j] <= prices[i], otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.

Return an array where the ith element is the final price you will pay for the ith item of the shop considering the special discount.

### Example:

Input: prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
Output: [4,2,4,2,3]
Explanation: 
For item 0 with price[0]=8 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[1]=4, therefore, the final price you will pay is 8 - 4 = 4. 
For item 1 with price[1]=4 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 4 - 2 = 2. 
For item 2 with price[2]=6 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 6 - 2 = 4. 
For items 3 and 4 you will not receive any discount at all.

## [(E)Problem 17](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Self_div_nums.py)

A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.

For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because 128 % 1 == 0, 128 % 2 == 0, and 128 % 8 == 0.

Also, a self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.

Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self dividing number, including the bounds if possible.

### Example 1:
Input: 
left = 1, right = 22
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22

Given an array A of non-negative integers, return an array consisting of all the even elements of A, followed by all the odd elements of A.

You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.

### Example 1:

Input: [3,1,2,4]
Output: [2,4,3,1]
The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.

## [(E)Problem 19](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Arthimetic_seq_detect.py)

Given an array of numbers arr. A sequence of numbers is called an arithmetic progression if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

Return true if the array can be rearranged to form an arithmetic progression, otherwise, return false.

### Example 1:

Input: arr = [3,5,1]
Output: true
Explanation: We can reorder the elements as [1,3,5] or [5,3,1] with differences 2 and -2 respectively, between each consecutive elements.

## [(E)Problem 20](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Make_two_arr_equal.py)

Given two integer arrays of equal length target and arr.

In one step, you can select any non-empty sub-array of arr and reverse it. You are allowed to make any number of steps.

Return True if you can make arr equal to target, or False otherwise.

### Example 1:

Input: target = [1,2,3,4], arr = [2,4,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: You can follow the next steps to convert arr to target:
1- Reverse sub-array [2,4,1], arr becomes [1,4,2,3]
2- Reverse sub-array [4,2], arr becomes [1,2,4,3]
3- Reverse sub-array [4,3], arr becomes [1,2,3,4]
There are multiple ways to convert arr to target, this is not the only way to do so.

## [(E)Problem 21](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/N_repeated_element.py)

In a array A of size 2N, there are N+1 unique elements, and exactly one of these elements is repeated N times.

Return the element repeated N times.

### Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3,3]
Output: 3

## [(E)Problem 22](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Robo_return_origin.py)

There is a robot starting at position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at (0, 0) after it completes its moves.

The move sequence is represented by a string, and the character moves[i] represents its ith move. Valid moves are R (right), L (left), U (up), and D (down). If the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its moves, return true. Otherwise, return false.

Note: The way that the robot is "facing" is irrelevant. "R" will always make the robot move to the right once, "L" will always make it move left, etc. Also, assume that the magnitude of the robot's movement is the same for each move.

### Example 1:

Input: "UD"
Output: true 
Explanation: The robot moves up once, and then down once. All moves have the same magnitude, so it ended up at the origin where it started. Therefore, we return true.

## [(E)Problem 23](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Hamming_dis.py)

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

### Example:

Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       â†‘   â†‘

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

### Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.

## [(E)Problem 28](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Lucky_num.py)

Given a m * n matrix of distinct numbers, return all lucky numbers in the matrix in any order.

A lucky number is an element of the matrix such that it is the minimum element in its row and maximum in its column.

### Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[3,7,8],[9,11,13],[15,16,17]]
Output: [15]
Explanation: 15 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column

## [(E)Problem 29](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Height_checker.py)

Students are asked to stand in non-decreasing order of heights for an annual photo.

Notice that when a group of students is selected they can reorder in any possible way between themselves and the non selected students remain on their seats.

### Example 1:

Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Current array : [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Target array  : [1,1,1,2,3,4]
On index 2 (0-based) we have 4 vs 1 so we have to move this student.
On index 4 (0-based) we have 1 vs 3 so we have to move this student.
On index 5 (0-based) we have 3 vs 4 so we have to move this student.

## [(E)Problem 30](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Avg_Salary.py)
Given an array of unique integers salary where salary[i] is the salary of the employee i.

Return the average salary of employees excluding the minimum and maximum salary.

### Example 1:

Input: salary = [4000,3000,1000,2000]
Output: 2500.00000
Explanation: Minimum salary and maximum salary are 1000 and 4000 respectively.
Average salary excluding minimum and maximum salary is (2000+3000)/2= 2500

## [(E)Problem 31](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Delete_cols.py)
We are given an array A of N lowercase letter strings, all of the same length.

Now, we may choose any set of deletion indices, and for each string, we delete all the characters in those indices.

For example, if we have an array A = ["abcdef","uvwxyz"] and deletion indices {0, 2, 3}, then the final array after deletions is ["bef", "vyz"], and the remaining columns of A are ["b","v"], ["e","y"], and ["f","z"].  (Formally, the c-th column is [A[0][c], A[1][c], ..., A[A.length-1][c]]).

Suppose we chose a set of deletion indices D such that after deletions, each remaining column in A is in non-decreasing sorted order.

Return the minimum possible value of D.length.

### Example 1:

Input: A = ["cba","daf","ghi"]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
After choosing D = {1}, each column ["c","d","g"] and ["a","f","i"] are in non-decreasing sorted order.
If we chose D = {}, then a column ["b","a","h"] would not be in non-decreasing sorted order.

## [(E)Problem 32](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Reverse_word.py)
Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

### Example 1:
Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"

## [(E)Problem 33](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Sort_parity_2.py)

Given an array A of non-negative integers, half of the integers in A are odd, and half of the integers are even.

Sort the array so that whenever A[i] is odd, i is odd; and whenever A[i] is even, i is even.

You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.

### Example 1:

Input: [4,2,5,7]
Output: [4,5,2,7]
Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been accepted.

## [(E)Problem 34](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/pop_push.py)
Given an array target and an integer n. In each iteration, you will read a number from  list = {1,2,3..., n}.

Build the target array using the following operations:

Push: Read a new element from the beginning list, and push it in the array.
Pop: delete the last element of the array.
If the target array is already built, stop reading more elements.
You are guaranteed that the target array is strictly increasing, only containing numbers between 1 to n inclusive.

Return the operations to build the target array.

You are guaranteed that the answer is unique.

### Example 1:

Input: target = [1,3], n = 3
Output: ["Push","Push","Pop","Push"]
Explanation: 
Read number 1 and automatically push in the array -> [1]
Read number 2 and automatically push in the array then Pop it -> [1]
Read number 3 and automatically push in the array -> [1,3]

## [(E)Problem 35](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/solider_civilian.py)
Given a m * n matrix mat of ones (representing soldiers) and zeros (representing civilians), return the indexes of the k weakest rows in the matrix ordered from the weakest to the strongest.

A row i is weaker than row j, if the number of soldiers in row i is less than the number of soldiers in row j, or they have the same number of soldiers but i is less than j. Soldiers are always stand in the frontier of a row, that is, always ones may appear first and then zeros.

### Example 1:

Input: mat = 
[[1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,0],
 [1,0,0,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,1]], 
k = 3
Output: [2,0,3]
Explanation: 
The number of soldiers for each row is: 
row 0 -> 2 
row 1 -> 4 
row 2 -> 1 
row 3 -> 2 
row 4 -> 5 
Rows ordered from the weakest to the strongest are [2,0,3,1,4]

## [(E)Problem 36](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Duplicates.py)
Given a string S of lowercase letters, a duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters, and removing them.

We repeatedly make duplicate removals on S until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.  It is guaranteed the answer is unique.

### Example 1:

Input: "abbaca"
Output: "ca"
Explanation: 
For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.  The result of this move is that the string is "aaca", of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".

## [(E)Problem 37](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Reverse_str.py)

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

### Example 1:

Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

## [(E)Problem 38](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/sort_by_bits.py)

Given an integer array arr. You have to sort the integers in the array in ascending order by the number of 1's in their binary representation and in case of two or more integers have the same number of 1's you have to sort them in ascending order.

Return the sorted array.

### Example 1:

Input: arr = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]
Explantion: [0] is the only integer with 0 bits.
[1,2,4,8] all have 1 bit.
[3,5,6] have 2 bits.
[7] has 3 bits.
The sorted array by bits is [0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]

## [(E)Problem 39](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/sort_relative.py)

Given two arrays arr1 and arr2, the elements of arr2 are distinct, and all elements in arr2 are also in arr1.

Sort the elements of arr1 such that the relative ordering of items in arr1 are the same as in arr2.  Elements that don't appear in arr2 should be placed at the end of arr1 in ascending order.

### Example 1:

Input: arr1 = [2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19], arr2 = [2,1,4,3,9,6]
Output: [2,2,2,1,4,3,3,9,6,7,19]

## [(E)Problem 40](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/email_address.py)

Every email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by the @ sign.

For example, in alice@leetcode.com, alice is the local name, and leetcode.com is the domain name.

Besides lowercase letters, these emails may contain '.'s or '+'s.

If you add periods ('.') between some characters in the local name part of an email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name.  For example, "alice.z@leetcode.com" and "alicez@leetcode.com" forward to the same email address.  (Note that this rule does not apply for domain names.)

If you add a plus ('+') in the local name, everything after the first plus sign will be ignored. This allows certain emails to be filtered, for example m.y+name@email.com will be forwarded to my@email.com.  (Again, this rule does not apply for domain names.)

It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.

Given a list of emails, we send one email to each address in the list.  How many different addresses actually receive mails? 

### Example 1:

Input: ["test.email+alex@leetcode.com","test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com","testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"]
Output: 2
Explanation: "testemail@leetcode.com" and "testemail@lee.tcode.com" actually receive mails

## [(E)Problem 41](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/fibonacci.py)

The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

F(0) = 0,   F(1) = 1
F(N) = F(N - 1) + F(N - 2), for N > 1.
Given N, calculate F(N).

### Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: 1
Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.

## [(E)Problem 42](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/words_form.py)

You are given an array of strings words and a string chars.

A string is good if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once).

Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.

### Example 1:

Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.

## [(E)Problem 43](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/short_dis.py)

Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.

Given a string S and a character C, return an array of integers representing the shortest distance from the character C in the string.

### Example 1:

Input: S = "loveleetcode", C = 'e'
Output: [3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0]

## [(E)Problem 44](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/dist_array.py)
Given two integer arrays arr1 and arr2, and the integer d, return the distance value between the two arrays.

The distance value is defined as the number of elements arr1[i] such that there is not any element arr2[j] where |arr1[i]-arr2[j]| <= d.

### Example 1:

Input: arr1 = [4,5,8], arr2 = [10,9,1,8], d = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
For arr1[0]=4 we have: 
|4-10|=6 > d=2 
|4-9|=5 > d=2 
|4-1|=3 > d=2 
|4-8|=4 > d=2 
For arr1[1]=5 we have: 
|5-10|=5 > d=2 
|5-9|=4 > d=2 
|5-1|=4 > d=2 
|5-8|=3 > d=2
For arr1[2]=8 we have:
|8-10|=2 <= d=2
|8-9|=1 <= d=2
|8-1|=7 > d=2
|8-8|=0 <= d=2

## [(E)Problem 45](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Chess.py)

On an 8 x 8 chessboard, there is one white rook.  There also may be empty squares, white bishops, and black pawns.  These are given as characters 'R', '.', 'B', and 'p' respectively. Uppercase characters represent white pieces, and lowercase characters represent black pieces.

The rook moves as in the rules of Chess: it chooses one of four cardinal directions (north, east, west, and south), then moves in that direction until it chooses to stop, reaches the edge of the board, or captures an opposite colored pawn by moving to the same square it occupies.  Also, rooks cannot move into the same square as other friendly bishops.

Return the number of pawns the rook can capture in one move.

### Example 1:
![Example](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/20/1253_example_1_improved.PNG)

Input: 
[[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."],
[".",".",".","p",".",".",".","."],
[".",".",".","R",".",".",".","p"],
[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."],
[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."],
[".",".",".","p",".",".",".","."],
[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."],
[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."]]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
In this example the rook is able to capture all the pawns.

## [(E)Problem 46](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/min_diff.py)

Given an array of distinct integers arr, find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference of any two elements. 

Return a list of pairs in ascending order(with respect to pairs), each pair [a, b] follows

a, b are from arr
a < b
b - a equals to the minimum absolute difference of any two elements in arr
 

### Example 1:

Input: arr = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Explanation: The minimum absolute difference is 1. List all pairs with difference equal to 1 in ascending order.
## [(E)Problem 47](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Alice_and_bob.py)
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number N on the chalkboard.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:

Choosing any x with 0 < x < N and N % x == 0.
Replacing the number N on the chalkboard with N - x.
Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return True if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.

### Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: true
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, and Bob has no more moves.

## [(E)Problem 48](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Goat_latin.py)
A sentence S is given, composed of words separated by spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase letters only.

We would like to convert the sentence to "Goat Latin" (a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.)

The rules of Goat Latin are as follows:

If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), append "ma" to the end of the word.
For example, the word 'apple' becomes 'applema'.
 
If a word begins with a consonant (i.e. not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add "ma".
For example, the word "goat" becomes "oatgma".
 
Add one letter 'a' to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with 1.
For example, the first word gets "a" added to the end, the second word gets "aa" added to the end and so on.
Return the final sentence representing the conversion from S to Goat Latin. 

### Example 1:

Input: "I speak Goat Latin"
Output: "Imaa peaksmaaa oatGmaaaa atinLmaaaaa"
## [(E)Problem 49](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Perimeter.py)
You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.

Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

### Example:

Input:
[[0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,1,0],
 [0,1,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0]]
 
## [(E)Problem 50](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/Matrix.py)
We are given a matrix with R rows and C columns has cells with integer coordinates (r, c), where 0 <= r < R and 0 <= c < C.

Additionally, we are given a cell in that matrix with coordinates (r0, c0).

Return the coordinates of all cells in the matrix, sorted by their distance from (r0, c0) from smallest distance to largest distance.  Here, the distance between two cells (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) is the Manhattan distance, |r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|.  (You may return the answer in any order that satisfies this condition.)

### Example 1:

Input: R = 1, C = 2, r0 = 0, c0 = 0
Output: [[0,0],[0,1]]
Explanation: The distances from (r0, c0) to other cells are: [0,1]

## [(E)Problem 51](https://github.com/Dravid92/100-days-of-leet-code/blob/Dravid/linear_duplicates.py)

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

### Example 1:

Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
